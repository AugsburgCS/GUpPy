The primary advantage of teaching beginning programming using GUpPy is that students can focus on solving a problem using a specific programming language, but without the frustration and deeply time-consuming process of debugging syntax errors.

GUpPy is a programming unplugged activity that helps students practice programming, computational thinking, and problem solving without a computer. The language follows the structure of Python (with
a few exceptions), making use of common programming constructs including variables, arithmetic expressions, Boolean expressions, functions, if-statements, and while loops. The outcome of a program is a pattern physically constructed on a grid with tiles of different colors. This mimics computer graphics in which images are created by coloring in pixels within a very large grid (i.e. a graphics window on the computer screen).
